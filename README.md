<h2>Testing activities</h2>
<a>Test preparation:</a>
<ol>
  <li><b>SPECIFICATION OVERVIEW:</b> I started by reviewing the application specifications. Already at this stage there were many inaccuracies and ambiguities. The presence of a tester at the initial stage of creating specifications, would help minimize the risk of similar errors.</li>
  <li><b>CREATION OF TEST CASES:</b>Based on the requirements, and the experience gathered during the course, I started creating test cases.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<a>Execution of tests</a>
<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>EXECUTION OF TEST CASES:</b>I conducted tests of the app on both a personal computer and a smartphone. When testing on the smartphone, I paid particular attention to device-specific features, such as the responsiveness of the screen when rotating the device or the app's behavior when receiving a phone call</li>
  <li><b>API TESTING:</b>I performed API tests using the tool "Swagger" (examples below)</li>
  <li><b>CREATING BUG REPORTS:</b>I collected and documented the bugs I found, creating reports with detailed information about each bug.</li>
</ol>
